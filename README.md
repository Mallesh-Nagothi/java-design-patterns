# java-design-patterns
This repository contains examples for important core java design patterns

<b>Object Oriented Pattern</b>
<b>1) The Strategy Pattern</b>: Use this pattern when behavior/algorithm vary independently of already existing client implementations. Define family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, so that we can attain interchangeability


<b>Object Oriented Principles</b>:
Encapsulate What Varies
Favor Composition over inheritence
Program to interface, not implementation

<b>2) The Observer Pattern</b>
One to many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically



<b>Design Principle</b>
Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact 

<b>Decorator Pattern</b>
<b>Object Oriented Principles</b>
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
